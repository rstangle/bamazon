# bamazon

PURPOSE:
The purpose of Bamazon is to allow online shoppers to see the inventory and make a purchase selection in the Bamazon Online Store.  Users will be shown the current inventory levels of in-stock items. They will then make a selection and once verified, make the purchase.  If the item is out of stock, it will not be shown.  If the user selects an amount that is greater than the current inventory levels, the system will alert the user and not allow the sale to go through. 

Once the sale has been verified, the stock levels will be adjusted accordingly.
